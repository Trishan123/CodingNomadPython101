# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
# 2) Convert a float to an int
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
#
# What information is lost during which conversions?
sum = 5 * 2.0 # I am adding the total for int to become a float
tum = 2.0  #I am assigning float
wum = int(tum) #now I am changing float to tum with an int assign to it
lum = 10.0 / 5 # I am dividing float to an in
aum = 2 * 5 # I am using two different variables to perform multi

print(sum)
print(wum)
print(lum)
print(aum)
